\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
This project has been developed as an assignment for the Computing (in H\+EP) exam.~\newline
The work is divided in three parts\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Data reading
\item Data manipulation
\item T\+M\+VA algorithm implementation
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_dataread_sec}{}\doxysection{Data reading}\label{index_dataread_sec}
L\+HC Olympics give sample files with extension \char`\"{}.\+h5\char`\"{}. It means that the user has to install H\+D\+F5 library and use a script to interact with sample files. This project gives some function, written in C++, useful to handle with $\ast$.h5 files.\hypertarget{index_read1}{}\doxysubsection{Step 1\+: Opening the box}\label{index_read1}
Files formatted in \char`\"{}.\+h5\char`\"{} usually have three main sub-\/structures\+: groups, datasets and datatypes.~\newline
\mbox{\hyperlink{OpenH5_8cpp_a1555d7f2837b776ca1c1057724719d18}{openh5}} let the user see the structure of the input file and store the information about the dataset in a vector of class \mbox{\hyperlink{classDatasetInfo}{Dataset\+Info}}, which holds the name of the dataset, the token that identifies it and its dimensions (dataset is supposed to be 2D).~\newline
\mbox{\hyperlink{OpenH5_8cpp_a1555d7f2837b776ca1c1057724719d18}{openh5}} goes through the file iteratively, using the \mbox{\hyperlink{Opfunc_8cpp_a8b60b0a325d8541b4f11e6f07158037c}{opfunc}} operator , which get the type and the info about the sub-\/structure stored in the input file.\hypertarget{index_read2}{}\doxysubsection{Step 2\+: Reading the dataset}\label{index_read2}
Reading the dataset is the most critical part of the project. H\+D\+F5 library memory management at the core level is \char`\"{}old fashioned\char`\"{}\+: the user must provide a buffer of the same type of the dataset that has to read and buffer\textquotesingle{}s dimensions have to be in the \char`\"{}boundaries\char`\"{} of the dataset. To solve this problem and maximize the reading efficiency, the user can use the function template Dataset\+\_\+2\+Dread.~\newline
 \mbox{\hyperlink{Dataset__2Dread_8h_a2dc8bccd62c373531d819d9900038ebc}{Dataset\+\_\+2\+Dread}} uses the template and the global variable \char`\"{}bufferdimension\char`\"{} to create an appropriate buffer to hold read data. Setting \char`\"{}bufferdimension\char`\"{} as high as user R\+AM can store means higher reading speed.~\newline
 \hypertarget{index_datamanipulation_sec}{}\doxysection{Data manipulation}\label{index_datamanipulation_sec}
\hypertarget{index_mani1}{}\doxysubsection{Writing the buffer to a root file}\label{index_mani1}
This project uses R\+O\+OT framework, so it\textquotesingle{}s useful to write read data to a $\ast$.root file. To write the buffer to a root file, user can call \mbox{\hyperlink{TreeCreator_8cpp_a4adefe4feab254092e7affdb23612755}{Tree\+Creator}}, which set up the correct template for \mbox{\hyperlink{Dataset__2Dread_8h_a2dc8bccd62c373531d819d9900038ebc}{Dataset\+\_\+2\+Dread}} which writes read buffer to the chosen root file.~\newline
 From now on, H\+D\+F5 is not needed.~\newline
 \hypertarget{index_mani2}{}\doxysubsection{Distinguishing signal, background and real event}\label{index_mani2}
Data written in the root files are parsed as suggested by L\+HC Olympics (700 hadrons described by their $ p_{T} $, $ \eta $, $ \Phi $). To distinguish background and signal events dataset contain an extra column. When this column is not present, the user can set up an optional value \char`\"{}sbflag\char`\"{} in the \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp_a0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97}{main}}, if the user knows additional information about dataset stored in the file. \mbox{\hyperlink{SBTreeCreator_8cpp_a05a336536b4319d31340617578e3d3f0}{S\+B\+Tree\+Creator}} creates an output file storing signal/background/event kinematics of the hadrons in the various dataset.\hypertarget{index_mani3}{}\doxysubsection{Jet clustering}\label{index_mani3}
In the end, \mbox{\hyperlink{SBTreeJetKinematicsCreator_8cpp_a427d768358beddfd8bdf39cef8f60cac}{S\+B\+Tree\+Jet\+Kinematics\+Creator}} clusters the hadrons with transverse momentum greater than $ p_{T, min} $ with a jet radius set by the user. Kinematics of the two most massive jets are stored in a root file.~\newline
 \hypertarget{index_tmvafactory}{}\doxysection{T\+M\+V\+A analysis}\label{index_tmvafactory}
These functions have to be customized by the user because mva methods have different parameters that have to be tuned.\hypertarget{index_The}{}\doxysubsection{T\+M\+V\+A\+::\+Factory}\label{index_The}
\mbox{\hyperlink{TMVAFactoryAnalysis_8cpp_a6166355dff2a50d1176f424e663a807a}{T\+M\+V\+A\+Factory\+Analysis}} set up a factory holding results of the user-\/defined algorithm analysis of the data sample.~\newline
 \hypertarget{index_The}{}\doxysubsection{T\+M\+V\+A\+::\+Factory}\label{index_The}
\mbox{\hyperlink{TMVAReaderAnalysis_8cpp_a7b3d253c269116bb57ac08c1adb226fc}{T\+M\+V\+A\+Reader\+Analysis}} analyzes a data sample using user-\/defined algorithms and their relative weights stored in the T\+M\+V\+A\+::\+Factory set up by the \mbox{\hyperlink{TMVAFactoryAnalysis_8cpp_a6166355dff2a50d1176f424e663a807a}{T\+M\+V\+A\+Factory\+Analysis}} function. This reader generates pdf and root files, storing the result of the analysis.~\newline
